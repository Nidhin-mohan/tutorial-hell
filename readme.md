# TutorialHell- A clean slate for new learning

Welcome to **TutorialHell** â€” my personal journey through tutorials and documentation! This repo serves as a central place for all my learning, experiments, and side projects as I work through various resources, mainly from YouTube and official docs.

Since learning is a never-ending process, instead of creating multiple repositories, I'm using this one repo and creating branches from the main for each tutorial or side project I work on.

## How to Use

- Browse through my practice projects and code snippets.
- Explore different branches for specific tutorials or side projects.
- Check out my notes and experiments as I try new things.
- Feel free to suggest improvements or contribute!

## Exploring Branches

Each tutorial or project is handled in its own branch. To see the different tutorials or side projects, you can explore the branches:

1. Go to the [Branches section](https://github.com/yourusername/TutorialHell/branches) of the repo.
2. Select a branch to check out the specific project/tutorial.

You can also clone the repo and check out the branches locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TutorialHell.git
cd TutorialHell
git checkout <branch-name>
```
